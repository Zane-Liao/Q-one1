# Q-one1


## Project Overview

This is a project that uses AI almost entirely, aiming to test the usability of AI tools. The project utilizes the latest large models from OpenAI, including the O1 series and the 4 series (Claude is currently unavailable due to repeated network issues).

## About My Background

I am a self-taught computer science student who is not familiar with front-end and back-end, and my understanding of them is still at the most basic conceptual level.

### Project Goal

The aim of this project is to develop a practical small tool that leverages AI technology to solve real-world problems. The technology stack has not yet been determined. The initial focus will be on defining requirements, writing documentation, and designing target prompts.

### Maintenance Plan

This project will be maintained for the long term, and if developers are willing to contribute and join in the future, they will be warmly welcomed.

### Current Progress

- Determining project requirements
- Writing documentation and target prompts
